### What is this repository for? ###

Just a small code churn analysis tool

### How do I get set up? ###

Just  change into the src directory and run make to compile a binary.
Then run './churny -h' to print information on its usage.

Note: there is also a bash script in this repository that also calculates code churn, but is no longer updated.
