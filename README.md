### What is this repository for? ###

Just a small code churn analysis tool

### How do I get set up? ###

As a requirement, libgit2 has to be installed. There are packages for many
popular repositories, otherwise have a look at http://libgit2.github.com.

If you have libgit2 installed, just change into the src directory and run make
to compile a binary. Then run './churny -h' to print information on its usage.

Note: there is also a bash script in this repository that also calculates code
churn, but is no longer updated.
